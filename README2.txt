* Partial_Minified : is a folder that SEPARATELY contains MINIFIED html, css, and js
* Partial_UnMinified : is a folder that SEPARATELY contains READABLE html, css, and js
* full_min.html : is a MINIFIED html file that already contains all css and js in it
* full_unMin.html : is a READABLE html file that already contains all css and js in it

## Why Minified File?
Minified file is a code that already minimized to REDUCE LOAD times and bandwith usage on websites. In other words, it will IMPROVES SITE SPEED and accessibility, directly translating into a better user experience. Yet, for humans, it is hard to read.
* If you want to send the code to someone, I recommend u to use full_min.html file, because it is already contains all the essential files in one, and have been minified.
